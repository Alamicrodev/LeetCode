# LeetCode Challenges: [Visit Here](https://leetcode.com/alamicrodev/) 

This repo is filled with leetcode challenges. I attempt to solve atleast 3 leet code challenges in a week. The idea is to keep improving myself with repitition and persistence.


## Languages used:

You may see me use any of the programming languages that I know but most of the times I use Javascript or Typescript.

## Optimizations: 

I often refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned: 

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve. 

Another lesson was reading and understanding other programmers' solutions helps improve your own ability.
